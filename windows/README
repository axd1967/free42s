I keep all the common files in the 'common' directory. In order to build the
Windows version, you must first copy these files from 'common' to 'windows'
using the copy-files script; if you modify any of them, you must copy them
back using the copy-back script before committing the changes to CVS.

Note: the Free42 workspace contains four projects: Free42Binary, Free42Decimal,
keymap2cpp, and skin2cpp. Before building Free42Binary and Free42Decimal, you
must build keymap2cpp and skin2cpp and run them; this creates the keymap.cpp
and skins.cpp files, which contain the default keymap and the skins to be
compiled into the Free42 executable.
